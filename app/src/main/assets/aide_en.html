    <ul>
        <li> Transplant and plant,</li>
        <li> Work the soil, bury fertilizers and soil improvers,</li>
        <li> Prune to slow growth and make more vigorous,</li>
        <li> Mow in the waning moon to slow the growth of the lawn,</li>
        <li> Lighten,</li>
        <li> Harvest the root vegetables,</li>
        <li> Take the cuttings and cut,</li>
        <li> Dividing and layering,</li>
        <li> Collect grafts,</li>
        <li> Harvest the root vegetables and bulbs.</li>
    </ul>
