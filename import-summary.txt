ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* Lunoid-12.apk
* Lunoid-14.apk
* Lunoid.apk
* Lunoid.avi
* Lunoid001.png
* Lunoid002.png
* Lunoid003.png
* Lunoid004.png
* Lunoid005.png
* Lunoid006.PNG
* Lunoid24.apk
* Lunoid_de_001.PNG
* Lunoid_de_002.PNG
* Lunoid_de_003.PNG
* Lunoid_en_001.PNG
* Lunoid_en_002.PNG
* Lunoid_en_003.PNG
* README.md
* androidkey
* lunoid2.avi
* lunoid_1024_500.png
* lunoid_180_120.png
* lunoid_180_20.png
* lunoid_512.png
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets
* lint.xml => app\lint.xml
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\
* lunoid_logo.PNG => lunoid_logo.png

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
